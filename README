Math-decNumber version 0.01
===========================

The Math::decNumber module is a Perl interface to the decNumber C library.
This library allows us to do arithmetic calculations in decimal and not in
binary as usual. The decimal arithmetic is preferred for business and
financial applications. This library complies with the IEEE 754 Standard
for Floating Point Arithmetic.
